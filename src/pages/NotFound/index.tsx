                    <Heading>404 - Page not found ðŸš€</Heading>
                    <p>
                        Oops! It looks like the page you're trying to access
                        doesn't exist. Maybe it went on vacation, decided to
                        explore the universe, or got lost somewhere between two
                        black holes. ðŸŒŒ
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But don't worry, you're not lost in space (yet). You can
                        safely return to the
                        <a href="/">home page</a> or
                        <a href="/history">your history</a> â€” or you can stay
                        here and pretend you found a secret page that only the
                        coolest explorers can access. ðŸ§­âœ¨
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you think this page should exist (or if you just want
                        to chat about time travel and wormholes), just get in
                        touch. Otherwise, use the menu to return to the real
                        world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, here's something to think about: "If a page
                        doesn't exist on the internet, did it ever really
                        exist?" ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­
                    </p>
                </GenericHtml>
            </Container>
        </MainTemplate>
    )
}
